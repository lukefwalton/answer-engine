# Answer Engine: An AI that Says "I Don't Know"

This is site-level search that uses an LLM **without being a chatbot**. You
point it at a body of work — essays, lyrics, letters, philosophy,
documentation — and it answers one question at a time, with no conversation
state, no memory, no persona improvising on your behalf. Each answer is a
one-shot transaction: question in, cited answer or honest refusal out. A
chatbot that's right most of the time speaks *for* you; an answer engine that
cites or declines speaks *from* you.

This repo is the teaching-sized version of the engine behind "Ask the
Archive" on [lukefwalton.com](https://lukefwalton.com). It runs out of the
box on a bundled example corpus (by "Person A" — a placeholder, not a
person), it's small enough to read in one sitting, and the whole design is
five ideas. Here they are, in the order the data flows.

## 1. Public records are quotable; private text is not

The corpus has two layers, and the distinction drives everything downstream
(`src/corpus.ts`, `src/types.ts`):

- **Records** are published pages — each markdown file becomes a flat,
  citable record: title, canonical URL, summary, curated themes, full body.
  The body travels all the way to the model, because you already published it.
- **Private notes** are material you want *searchable but never quotable* —
  here, the songwriter's notebook in `example-content/notebook/`. Each note
  declares the public page it routes to (`about`) and where the moment lives
  (`locator`). Its text gets embedded, so retrieval can find it. It is never
  shown to the model.

> In production, the private layer is chunked podcast transcripts — hours of
> guests' words that routing can point into but the engine must never quote.
> This repo uses hand-written notebook entries to show the same boundary
> without the transcription pipeline.

## 2. Retrieval returns both; assembly strips prose

Both layers share one embedding space in one versioned index file
(`artifacts/index.json` — gitignored, because vectors derived from private
text are private). Retrieval (`src/retrieve.ts`) scores everything with
brute-force cosine plus two conservative boosts — naming a work's title
(0.30) and using a curated theme verbatim (0.15), because metadata you
maintain should outrank raw similarity — and drops anything under a score
floor. Weak matches don't get to masquerade as evidence; an empty result is
where "I don't know" begins, before any model is involved.

The result keeps records and notes in **two separate lists**, because what
happens next is different for each:

```
                 ┌── records ────────────────────────────► quotable, citable
corpus ─► index ─┤                                         (body travels)
                 └── private notes ──► retrieval finds
                     the moment        │
                                       ▼
                              assembleEvidence()           src/no-leak.ts
                                       │  strips the text
                                       ▼
                         RoutingHint { hintId, label,
                                       url, locator }      ◄─ no field for prose
                                       │
                     AnswerEvidence = { records, hints } ──► the model
```

`src/no-leak.ts` is eight lines of logic and it is the whole point:
`RoutingHint` has **no field for the note's text**, so code that tried to
hand private prose to the model would not compile. The boundary is a type,
not a guard somebody remembers to write.

## 3. The model only sees AnswerEvidence

One Responses API call (`src/answer.ts`), with the policy versioned in code
(`src/prompt.ts`): records render with their bodies; hints render as label,
locator, and URL — `buildUserPrompt` couldn't leak a hint's text if it wanted
to, because the field doesn't exist. The model is told what a hint *is*: the
location of a relevant private moment, to be routed to, never restated. If no
evidence cleared the floor at all, the engine returns `not-found` without
making the call — refusal costs nothing.

## 4. Modes are enforced in schema + validator, not vibes

The answer declares one of four modes, and the modes exactly partition the
citation mix — which makes honesty checkable:

| Mode | Citations | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `supported` | records + hints | claims grounded in the canon, plus where to look further |
| `partial` | records only | answered from the canon; no private moment bears on it |
| `related-material` | hints only | "I can't quote it, but the moment exists — here" |
| `not-found` | none, empty answer | "I don't know," plainly |

Three layers enforce this, because the first two are requests and only the
third is a guarantee: the JSON schema constrains the shape; `validateAnswer`
rejects contract violations (a `not-found` with prose, a sourced mode without
it); then `repairCitationsToEvidence` snaps almost-right citations onto the
exact retrieved pairs (models mangle URLs more often than they invent
sources), dedupes, and **re-derives the mode from the final mix** — the model
can't claim `supported` while citing nothing but hints. Finally
`assertCitationsGroundedInEvidence` verifies every citation is the exact
(id, url) pair of something actually retrieved. An invented source is an
error, not a footnote.

## 5. Gold queries are regression tests for answerability

`eval/gold.yaml` is a fixed set of questions with required behavior —
including questions the engine must refuse, and one that must route to the
notebook without quoting it. `npm run eval` checks retrieval (one cheap
batched embedding call); `-- --full` runs the answer engine and checks modes.

The rule that makes the eval worth having: **when a query fails, fix the
corpus, the scoring, or the prompt — never special-case the question.** We
learned that the hard way; [`eval/README.md`](./eval/README.md) tells the
story, including a real failing-then-passing walkthrough.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 22+ and an OpenAI API key.

```sh
npm install
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." > .env

npm run index                                   # embed the example corpus, both layers
npm run ask -- "what does person a think about routine?"      # → supported, cites the essay
npm run ask -- "how was the bridge in harbor lights written?" # → related-material, routes to the notebook
npm run ask -- "what does person a think about crypto?"       # → I don't know.
npm run eval                                    # the promises, checked
```

The default models are set in `archive.config.ts`; if your key doesn't have
access to the configured answer model, swap in any Responses-API model you do
have — the engine adapts (reasoning models get an effort setting, others get
`temperature: 0`).

## Make it yours

1. Edit `archive.config.ts`: your name, your archive's name, your base URL,
   where your markdown lives.
2. Each collection is a directory of `.md`/`.mdx` files. The filename stem is
   the slug — it becomes part of the record id and the public URL, so name
   files the way you want your citations to read. Frontmatter the engine
   reads: `title` (required), `description`/`summary`/`meaning`,
   `themes`/`keywords`/`topics`, `date`, `draft: true` to skip a file.
3. Private notes additionally need `about` (the public URL to route to) and
   `locator` (where the moment lives). One contract to respect: a note's
   `title` and `locator` ARE public-safe surface — they travel into hints and
   answers — so write them like captions, not like the note itself. Only the
   body is private. No private layer? Remove `privateNotesDir` from the
   config and the engine runs public-only.
4. Replace `example-content/` with your corpus and rerun `npm run index`.
5. Rewrite `eval/gold.yaml` for your corpus — keep the refusals.

## Commands

```
npm run index       # build/refresh artifacts/index.json (only embeds changes)
npm run ask         # ask one question, get a cited answer
npm run eval        # gold set, retrieval checks (-- --full to check answers too)
npm test            # offline, deterministic engine tests — no API key
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
```

## Where to take it

In the order we'd add them: chunk long documents into overlapping windows so
retrieval points at passages; more retrieval signals (recency for "what do
you think *now*", author aliases, per-collection weights); a
document-frequency cap on the theme boost — at four records a verbatim theme
match is signal, but on a large corpus a theme that appears on half the
records boosts nothing and should be discounted; an HTTP handler
around `retrieve` + `answerQuestion` with a rate limit, query cap, and cache;
SQLite or pgvector when the archive outgrows in-memory cosine — the shapes
don't change. In production we also keep the wire contract's `not-found`
empty and let the UI roll plain decline copy at display time, so refusals
stay honest *and* human.

Contributions welcome — the bar for new code is the bar the repo sets for
itself: least lines that keep the promises, boundaries enforced by types or
runtime checks, loud failures, and no change that makes the eval pass by
special-casing a question.
